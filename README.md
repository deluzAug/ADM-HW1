# ADM-HW1

## This repository contains all the python scripts for the exercises to be completed on HackerRank.

### Problem 1:
The files related to this problem have been split into different folders, each referring to a section on HackerRank. This has been done in order to permit me to work on VScode and to commit groups of multiple exercises at a time and also run each script with ease, keeping me organised. In the main folder is also located the required PDF file and a Jupyter Notebook containing all the different scripts.

### Problem 2: 
The files are 6 so I simply saved them separatedly while I was working on them. I've also made a Jupyter notebook containing all the scripts and provided the PDF with the submission page screenshots. 

### Additional Infos:
Some of the scripts have two versions becouse I sometime thought of better ways to solve them. BOTH of the scripts passed all the tests provided by the platform, it was done just for my personal satisfaction.
