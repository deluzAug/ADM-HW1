# ADM-HW1

## Repository linked to my Homework #1 submission, through HakerRank

### Problem 1:
The files related to this problem have been split into different folders, each referring to a category in the Python section on HackerRank. This has been done in order to permit me to work on VScode and to commit groups of exercises at a time and also run each script with ease and keeping me organised. In the main folder is also located the required PDF file and a Jupyter Notebook containing all the different scripts.
